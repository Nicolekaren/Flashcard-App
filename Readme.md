## Flashcard App

## Lab 4

### App Description
This app allows the user to create flashcards and go through them. Whenever the user clicks on a question, the flashcard does a flipping animation as it reveals the answer. The users can also see a sliding animation of the flashcards as they go through the next and previous cards. The app has an app icon you can see from the home screen and it also has a splash screen.
